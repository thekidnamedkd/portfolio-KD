Your digital projects deserve to be made whole - visual, compelling, and useful.

As a project manager and web developer with years of experience in complex multimedia projects, interdisciplinary task management, and a technology-first approach - I am eager to take your concepts from the whiteboard to the world wide web.

Originally from Portland, Oregon, I've spent the last decade criss-crossing the continent from New York City to Los Angeles to Mexico City, learning the entertainment industry, large scale event production, good design practice, and modern computer programming.

Art, justice, movies, journalism, and the future are all things we can talk about. ðŸš€ðŸŽ·ðŸŒŽ
