An anti-doldrum motivator - a mobile app that will intake new users and suggest actionable goals and remove roadblocks that can get in the way of ever starting good habits. Using various API's to integrate with the apps you already love like Spotify, the app combines an array of microservices into a gamified cycle of inventive to-do's and habit tracking. â€˜Brioâ€™ was developed during an 8 week full time agile internship at EyeCue Lab and was built with React Native, Node.js, Redux Saga, Expo, and Styled Components.
