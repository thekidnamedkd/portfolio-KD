dotGain aims to be a reliable place to gather and view art that has been made around social justice movements and then provide those who wish to support those artists and independent print shops with their business rather than FedEx or other corporate outlets. Bootstrapped with Gatsby and created to take advantage of a content mesh using microservices from various APIs and GraphQL to show a number of concepts including agile development, modern content management, and eCommerce solutions.
